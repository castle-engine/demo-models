# Shape Keys (Blender name) aka Morph Targets (glTF name) test

Note that _Castle Game Engine_ and _Castle Model Viewer_  ( https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php ) do not support morph targets yet.

See https://castle-engine.io/gltf :

> TODO: Main missing glTF feature is morph targets. It is coming!

This is a testcase to test the upcoming future support.

For now, you can test it e.g. in https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ .
