# Two tests actually:
# - if you compile textureimages.pas with DEBUG_CACHE, you should see that
#   random3d.dds is loaded only once (even though it's used by two different
#   ImageTexture3D nodes, even with different repeatS/T/R)
# - warnings about wrong files for first ImageTexture3D should be nice,
#   and eventually result in loading random3d.dds, and no memory leaks should occur.
