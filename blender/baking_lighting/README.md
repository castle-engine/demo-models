# Lights baking example

This example shows how to bake lights in Blender.

The idea is to save everything (shadows, lights, input textures) into a baked texture. The final model can then be rendered unlit, with the baked texture providing the lighting effect.

We document the process, with screeshots, in the _"Baking lighting"_ section of our [Blender manual](https://castle-engine.io/blender).
