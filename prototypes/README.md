_Prototypes_ are a feature of X3D to define something that "looks like a new node"
by a composition of existing nodes.
See X3D specification,
see also X3DOM nice docs: https://github.com/x3dom/x3dom/wiki/Prototypes .

_External prototypes_ are a feature of X3D to define something that "looks like a new node"
that is implemented externally.
It may refer to an regular prototype in another X3D file,
it may refer (using URN) to some browser-specific implementation.

This directory contains _Castle Game Engine_ tests of prototypes and external prototypes.
