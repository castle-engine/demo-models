#VRML V2.0 utf8

# Demonstrates specifying precalculated normals in VRML file.
# Note that some normals are intentionally set to wrong values
# in this file --- to actually see how VRML browser uses them.
#
# Note that this is a little smaller than corresponding VRML 1.0
# test file in ../vrml_1/normals.wrl since VRML 2.0 approach
# is a little simpler, and you just can't express some things
# --- e.g. IndexedLineSet is always unlit, so it never has
# normals.
