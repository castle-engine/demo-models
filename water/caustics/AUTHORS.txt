Water caustics demo by Victor Amat (thousand thanks!).

Remade later by Michalis Kamburelis to use Castle Game Engine
shader effects ( https://castle-engine.io/shaders )
to cooperate with engine shaders.

Available under a modified LGPL license: it's the same license
as used by "Castle Game Engine", see
http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/engine.php#section_license .
In the future, we'd like to port some of these effects to the engine core,
to make such beatiful water available out-of-the-box for other 3D worlds.
