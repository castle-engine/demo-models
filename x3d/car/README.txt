Low-poly 3D car model with a texture resembling a comic look.

Available in Blender (source) and X3D format.

- The Blender source file contains both a car and a trivial textured plane to show a road.

- The X3D version was exported from Blender, and then had some manual editing to define a "wheels_turning" animation.

The X3D file can be opened and animated in Castle Game Engine ( https://castle-engine.io/ , as shown in the manual: https://castle-engine.io/manual_scene.php ). In particular, you can quickly try it out by opening in our model viewer, view3dscene: https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php .
